# DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets with modifications by Robert Winslow Dalpe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwdalpe/xslt20-stylesheets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwdalpe/xslt20-stylesheets)

This is a fork of <http://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets>.

Resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are maintained in
[a separate repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-resources).

Some image options, such as scaling, require information about the intrinsic
size of the image. There are Java extension functions for this purpose.
They are maintained in
[another repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-java). Put them
on your class path. They are also
[in Maven](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22docbook-xsl-java-saxon%22), if you prefer.
